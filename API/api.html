<!--  API stands for Application Programming Interface "
  :- It is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other."-->
  <!-- ✅ API works in different places:
Between our Frontend and our Backend:

The frontend (like an HTML/JS website) uses APIs to send or fetch data from its own server/backend.

Example: A user fills a login form, and JavaScript sends the data to /api/login.

Between our Backend and another Backend:

Our server might need data from another service or external API, like payment gateways, weather info, maps, etc.

Example: Your backend calls the Stripe API to charge a card or the OpenWeather API to get weather data.

Between our Frontend and another Backend:

Sometimes the frontend directly calls a public API from another company (CORS and security permitting).

Example: Your frontend fetches GitHub user data using https://api.github.com/users/username.
APIs Work Even if Programming Languages Are Different:

APIs use standard formats like HTTP and JSON, so it doesn't matter if one side is using JavaScript and the other is using Python, Java, or PHP.

🧩 Example:

Frontend (JavaScript) → Backend (Python Flask)

Your backend (Node.js) → External API (written in Java or Go)

As long as both sides understand the API contract (endpoint + JSON structure), they can communicate. -->
